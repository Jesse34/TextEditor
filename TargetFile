Hello
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
seven
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
